# Logistic-Regression
<ul>
<li>Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms, which comes under the Supervised Learning technique. 
It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables. </li>                                           
<li>Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable. Therefore the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value.
It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1</li></ul>

### Assumptions for Logistic Regression:                    
o	The dependent variable must be categorical in nature.                                    
o	The independent variable should not have multi-collinearity.
 
### Type of Logistic Regression:                                  
On the basis of the categories, Logistic Regression can be classified into three types:     

o	<b>Binomial</b> : In binomial Logistic regression, there can be only two possible types of the dependent variables, such as 0 or 1, Pass or Fail, etc.                     
o	<b>Multinomial</b> : In multinomial Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible unordered types of the dependent variable, such as "cat", "dogs", or "sheep"                       
o	<b>Ordinal</b> : In ordinal Logistic regression, there can be 3 or more possible ordered types of dependent variables, such as "low", "Medium", or "High".
